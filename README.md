# Quick Password Generator Starter Code

## The Motivation

My motivation for this project is to delve into making a site more interactive and getting more comfortable with Javascript. There was a lot of ways I could've approached this and it has grown my skills in the language.

## Challenges

The main issue I dealt with was understanding the many nuances with Javascript. I had to implement many different tools such as arrays and if statments to get this project to work appropriately
